// ðŸ”¹ Q1: What is a code smell?
/*
A code smell is a surface indication that usually corresponds to a deeper problem in the system.
It doesn't always mean a bug, but suggests refactoring is needed.
*/

// ðŸ”¹ Q2: What are examples of common code smells?
/*
- Long Method
- Large Class
- Duplicated Code
- Too Many Dependencies
- Switch/If Chain (when misused)
*/

// ðŸ”¹ Q3: Why are long methods a problem?
/*
They are harder to understand, test, and maintain. Usually indicate multiple responsibilities (SRP violation).
*/

// ðŸ”¹ Q4: Whatâ€™s wrong with large classes?
/*
They often do too many things and violate the SRP.
Refactor into smaller cohesive classes/modules.
*/

// ðŸ”¹ Q5: How do you eliminate duplicate code?
/*
Extract common logic into functions, extensions, or utilities. DRY principle!
*/

// ðŸ”¹ Q6: When is using `when` or `if-else` a code smell?
/*
When used as a substitute for polymorphism (like replacing behavior branching with type checking).
Can be refactored using sealed classes, strategy pattern, etc.
*/

// ðŸ”¹ Q7: Why are too many constructor dependencies bad?
/*
It makes classes harder to test and violates the Single Responsibility Principle.
Refactor using delegation or composition.
