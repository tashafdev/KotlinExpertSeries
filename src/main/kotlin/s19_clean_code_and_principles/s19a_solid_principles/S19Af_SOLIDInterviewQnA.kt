// ðŸ”¹ Q1: What is the S in SOLID â€” Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)?
/*
A class should have only one reason to change â€” i.e., one responsibility.
In Kotlin, this often means separating logic into services, repositories, and UI.
*/

// ðŸ”¹ Q2: What is the O â€” Open/Closed Principle?
/*
Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Use interfaces or abstract classes to extend behaviors without changing existing code.
*/

// ðŸ”¹ Q3: What is the L â€” Liskov Substitution Principle?
/*
Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
If class B is a subtype of A, then objects of type A should be replaceable with objects of type B without breaking the application.
*/

// ðŸ”¹ Q4: What is the I â€” Interface Segregation Principle?
/*
Donâ€™t force classes to implement interfaces they don't use.
Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.
*/

// ðŸ”¹ Q5: What is the D â€” Dependency Inversion Principle?
/*
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Use interfaces and inject them via constructor or function parameters.
*/
