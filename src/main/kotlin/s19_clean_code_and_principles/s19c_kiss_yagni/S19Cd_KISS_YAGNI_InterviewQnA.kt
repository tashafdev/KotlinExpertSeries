// ðŸ”¹ Q1: What does KISS stand for?
/*
KISS = Keep It Simple, Stupid.
Code should be as simple as possible to solve the problem â€” no unnecessary complexity.
*/

// ðŸ”¹ Q2: Why is the KISS principle important?
/*
- Simple code is easier to read, maintain, and debug.
- Complexity adds risk, slows down delivery, and invites bugs.
- Encourages clarity and directness in problem-solving.
*/

// ðŸ”¹ Q3: What does YAGNI stand for?
/*
YAGNI = You Arenâ€™t Gonna Need It.
Donâ€™t implement features you *think* you might need in the future â€” only build what's needed now.
*/

// ðŸ”¹ Q4: Why is YAGNI important?
/*
- Avoids wasting time and effort on unused features.
- Reduces code bloat and technical debt.
- Keeps your code focused and lean.
*/

// ðŸ”¹ Q5: How do KISS and YAGNI relate to clean architecture in Kotlin?
/*
In MVVM or Clean Architecture:
- KISS encourages thin ViewModels, readable UseCases, and direct logic.
- YAGNI helps you avoid premature abstractions or unused layers (like unnecessary Repositories or Interfaces).
